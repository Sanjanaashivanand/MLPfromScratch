## Multilayer Perceptron and CNN Implementation

This project provides examples of implementing both a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) from scratch on a random dataset and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras on the MNIST dataset, all within the same Jupyter notebook.

### 1. Multilayer Perceptron from Scratch

#### Objective
- Build a flexible MLP architecture adaptable to different hidden node configurations.
- Utilize Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function.
- Explore learning modes, rates, and potential momentum terms.

#### Implementation
- Implement MLP from scratch in Python without relying on existing libraries.
- Demonstrate the process on a randomly generated dataset.

### 2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Keras on MNIST Dataset

#### Objective
- Design and implement a CNN using Keras.
- Recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
- Experiment with various hyperparameters.

#### Implementation
- Employ Keras deep learning library for CNN construction.
- Train the model on the MNIST dataset and experiment with different hyperparameters.

#### File
- `Notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing both implementations.

#### Instructions
1. Open `Notebook.ipynb` using Jupyter notebook.
2. Navigate through the notebook to explore the implementations of both MLP from scratch and CNN using Keras.
3. Experiment with different hyperparameters and datasets as per the provided examples.

### Note
- Ensure that the required libraries are installed (`numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `tensorflow`, `keras`) before running the notebook.
